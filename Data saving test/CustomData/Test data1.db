#  This line will be ignored in the parsing

#  There are many parameters for the parsing function


    White space will be also be destroyed
    (although you can cancel that)
$Notice that in this line, the white space is kept     without   losses   :0
@You can do it with any special character you like

The intended use of the parsing function is for data like this

# This will not be seen in the parsed section
# If you enable a special filter
